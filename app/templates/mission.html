        <strong> Weconnec intends to resolve the need for a central <br>platform that allows, primarily students to share resources<br> among themselves. Often times barriers impede how<br> effective study resources are shared among students. One <br> such barrier is association. Students may not know the <br> right persons to  be affiliated with in order to get<br> helpful resources. In addition, the project also <br> seeks to enhance how efficient students can <br> manipulate study resources.</strong>
